# Tilted UI

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/TiltedPhoques/TiltedUI/_apis/build/status/tiltedphoques.TiltedUI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/TiltedPhoques/TiltedUI/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

This is the ui library used by all C++ projects by Tilted Phoques.

It is based on Chromium Embedded Framework which allows us to use standard HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript for the UI.

## Build

Because Github's LFS quotas are dumb we cannot check in the CEF dependencies, you will thus need to download the files manually from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mSfJNrz_ACRYFapp-irPk9_rum4DLDGR and unpack it at the root of the project.
